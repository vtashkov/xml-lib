## Rust XML Library

The ultimate goal is xml-lib to become high-performance, production-grade XML library for Rust, which provides SAX parser/writer, DOM tree, DTD, XML schema validation, XPath, XQuery, and maybe XSLT. Whether this goal will be achieved ot this will remain just an educational project remains to be seen.
