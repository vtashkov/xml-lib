## Rust XML Library

The ultimate goal is xml-lib to become high-performance, production-grade XML library for Rust, which provides SAX parser/writer, DOM tree, DTD, XML schema validation, XPath, XQuery, and maybe XSLT. Whether this goal will be achieved or this will remain just an educational project remains to be seen.

Currently this crate contains absolutely nothing!
